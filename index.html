        <h2><a id="Outcome1"></a>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, computer technology is used in every department across small businesses and multinationals. Departments like HR, finance, operations, sales and communications to name a few rely heavily on IT to work. Just imagine if the internet or phone service went down in an office, nothing could get done!. The purpose of IT is not only to work with data but also to keep it safe from a world of technological threats.</p>
        <p>Research from the last two decades has proved that those organisations that do invest in technology and choose the path of innovation increase their market share, financial figures and overall competitiveness.</p>
        <p><u>These are some of the areas that IT can improve :</u></p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Decision Making:</b> Currently, Big data, Analytics and CRM software are great tools to extract useful information which can impact on decision making. These online tools not only provide real-time responses from the potential audience but also ensure the accuracy of data by minimising the risk of human errors.</li>        
        <li><b>Marketing and Business Growth:</b> IT allows us to identify at the granular level our target audience, observing its trends and needs. Companies have understood that long term success without a digital presence on the Internet.</li>
        <li><b>Customer Support and Satisfaction:</b> A happy customer base is important for the growth of a business. Various cloud-based communication channels have improved the customer experience. IT provides the best tools for communicating with customers and solving their problems in real-time (e.g. Email, Social media and other messaging platforms). On top of that, the use of CRM software let us hold data to understand the customer’s behaviours.</li>
        <li><b>Resource Management:</b> Thanks to the Internet, cloud technology and cloud-based ERP solutions, the managers can manage or monitor their organisational resources virtually anywhere in the world by using their personal computer, laptops, tablets or Smartphone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?.</h2>
        <p>It’s critical to choose the most appropriate approach (method) for a successful project management. Depending on the simplicity, the complexity or the flexibility of a project, one method may be more suitable than another. This choice is also affected by the needs of the client and which one offers more value.</p>
        <p>While it’s impossible to predict a project’s success 100%, you can take certain steps to ensure a project is heading in the right direction.</p>
        <p>It's really important to choose wisely the right method, to have the right tools and to have the right skills in order to achieve the best outcome.</p>
        <p><u>The most usual methods are:</u> </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b👉Agile:</b> collaborating to iteratively deliver whatever works. It's a people-focused, results-focused approach.</li>            
        <li><b>👉Scrum:</b> based on the agile principles, it enables a small self-managed team to deliver fast.</li>
        <li><b>👉Kanban:</b> increases the visibility of work, improves speed and quality, and limits multi-tasking. It's based on the principle "to do", "doing" and "done".</li>
        <li><b>👉Scrumban:</b> a mix between Scrum and Kanban.</li>
        <li><b>👉Lean:</b> focuses on delivering more with less or simply put, creating more value for customers with fewer resources.</li>
        <li><b>👉Waterfall:</b> projects are planned fully, but executed in phases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>The essential Tools</u> for project management are: task lists, shared team calendars, time tracking software, team communication capabilities, charts, reporting software, file storage, etcetera.</p>
        <p>However, there are all-in-one solutions in the market such as <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>, <a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a> or <a href="https://freedcamp.com/" target="_blank">Freedcamp</a> to name a few.</p>
        <p><u>The Skills needed</u> for success are: effective communication, negotiation, time management, leadership, technical expertise, risk management, critical thinking and problem solving.</p>

        <p>For this project, I mainly applied the <strong>Kanban</strong> methodology when planning my workflow. The <strong>Trello</strong> boards show you what needs to be done, the status of all tasks, and where potential bottlenecks could be.</p>
        <p>I tried to break down the tasks needed to create this project by using labels and checklists within my Trello boards, adding deadlines when needed. There was no need to be too granular in this case though. Additionally, I included my instructor, so that he could assist me.</p>
        <p>In short, I just wanted to keep it <u>simple and effective</u> (KISS principle).</p>

    <h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?.</h2>
    <p>Project failure can happen in any organization and to any project. There are an infinite number of reasons for failure. Sometimes it’s out of the control of a project manager and/or the team members. Sometimes failure is controllable. Failed projects and people involved with the failure have some things in common.</p>
    <p><u>Risks that may impact digital projects:</u></p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Research & Strategy:</b> Time spent understanding the client and making recommendations on those understandings in the form of deliverables.</li>
    <li><b>Digital Design:</b> The actual visuals that help to represent what your project will look like.</li>
    <li><b>Development:</b> The front-end styling and the back-end functioning of what the digital project is supposed to accomplish.</li>
    <li><b>Content:</b> What your website or portal says. The blogs, the posts, the pages and the case studies.</li>
    <li><b>Visual Media:</b> The photos and videos that are peppered throughout your digital tool.</li>
    <li><b>Launch:</b> The taking of the site from a staging server to a production environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</u></p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Failing to account for business processes:</b> Taking time to understand the internal systems that will drive positive customer experience, and making sure you map how your new digital project works within those processes.</li>
    <li><b>Failing to secure all executive buy-in:</b> Problems happen when the projects inevitably spill across departments and suddenly, the executives who didn’t support the vision at the start are asked to participate and sign off on some change to their domain.</li>
    <li><b>Not investing in customer value:</b> Make sure to take into consideration why you’re doing the project, what business problem it solves and what customer needs it solves.</li>
    <li><b>Poor expectations setting:</b> Control expectations. It feels counter-intuitive when you’re pitching, but limits your digital project to a clearly defined, single entity. Ensure that it’s clear from the start what’s excluded or included.</li>
    <li><b>Poor vendor selection:</b> Make sure you read reviews of your vendor, evaluate multiple options, and ask for references from similar companies or projects that they’ve worked on before.</li>

    <p>The <strong>GDPR</strong> is the right to access the users’ personal data and the right to know how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. </p>
    <p>It is made of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><u>The right to be forgotten and have their data deleted.</u></li>
    <li><u>The right to data portability from one service provider to another.</u></li>
    <li><u>The right to be informed about how the company gathers its data.</u></li>
    <li><u>The right to have the information corrected if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.</u></li>
    <li><u>The right to restrict processing of their data.</u></li>
    <li><u>The right to object and stop the processing of their data for direct marketing.</u></li>
    <li><u>The right to be notified if there has been a data breach within 72 hours.</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The collection of the user’s data in digital projects (e.g. form submissions, email marketing, sign up to use the service, etc..) needs to be compliant with the GDPR guidelines and <u>requires planning</u> on how to implement them into the project. Needless to say that the fines for breaching these principles are huge and can impact the reputation of a business in a really bad way.</p>

    <br>
    <p>👍 Absolutely!. In the past, whenever I made some personal projects before this course I have never used an IDE (just the notepad or the <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> editor), and I really can see the value of using it.</p>

    <h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, 
        Trello.</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is a very powerful tool, it supports plenty of scripting and programming languages and it’s available for the major OSs out there. The fact that the syntax is 🌈 coloured, the error detector on the fly and plenty of shortcuts available is a huge addition when working on any project. But it even can be improved further by installing a great range of <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode" target="_blank">add-ons</a> (e.g. Beautify, Live Server, and many more). Maybe, the lack of capabilities of teamworking is the only flaw that I can find so far. </p>
    <p><a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> is awesome to gather all the information related to a project, as well as deadlines, break-down of tasks, team members in charge of different tasks, attachment of files and many more interesting features. All members can see how the project is going and everyone is kept updated about the ongoings of the project. </p>

        your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the 
        interests of openness. What would you change?.</h2>
    <p>In regards to the <u>strengths</u>, I think that the visual style of my website is very readable and it’s easy to navigate. I tried to keep it simple, but visually pleasing including a “Parallax effect” built upon HTML and CSS without using the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap framework</a>. The number of extra features has been kept to a minimum to ease up the user’s interaction with the site (custom scroll bar to match the colours of the site, customised cursor when hovering links and a go-to-top feature). The site itself loads fast, as I tried to simplify the code as much as I could and I optimised the images to ensure fast loading by using <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">Tinypng</a>. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, related to the <u>weaknesses</u>, maybe this layout is not ideal for a multi-page site or a site containing lots of content. I would have to rethink the layout in that case, but definitely it could be accomplished. </p> 
    <p>Overall, I am quite happy 😃 with the result as all the time I have invested has paid off.</p>

    <p>However, there’s always room for improvement. In case that the website was fully deployed on a <strong>server</strong>, I would have also worked on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>👉Lazy loading</strong> (asynchronous loading) to speed up the load times so that this could improve its SEO.</li>
        <li><strong>👉Improving the accessibility.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Improving the images.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Including more outbound links.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Working on back-links.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Creating a nice looking 404 page.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Mobile optimisation</strong>: mobile-first policy.</li>
        <li><strong>👉Making it responsive using media queries.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Including social sharing features.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉CDN Files Upload.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Making use of interactive infographics.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉Linking Google Analytics.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👉And many more!</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <p>Another thing that I definitely would include is a <strong>nice form</strong> so that I could interact with my visitors.</p>
    <p>Something that would improve this project could be a redesign of the layout by using the combination of CSS <em>Grid</em> and <em>Flexbox</em>, but I need some training first to do so. More <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript" target="_blank">Javascript</a> would be more than welcome when enhances the <u>interactivity</u> for the user. I am planning to start learning about that next.</p>    
    <p>Anyway, in my humble opinion I honestly think I have gone above and beyond the expectations given the time allocated for this project. ✔️</p>

    <p>On top of that, I changed the file formats of the images in order to use just a single type of them while optimising them without any quality loss.</p>
    <p>To ensure easy navigation within the site, I set up a <strong>navbar</strong> linking all sections, nothing too fancy but it does the job.</p>
    <p>By testing thoroughly the entire site, I made sure that I was providing the user with a <u>clean and pleasant experience</u>.</p>

        productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your 
        website? How? Could you have done it in teams?.</h2>
    <p>The <u>benefits</u> of using the tools taught in this course (<strong>Visual Studio</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong> and <strong>Slack</strong>) are noticeable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>👉I really like using <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> (which I learnt how to use it in a previous job) and the more you use it, the more efficient you become by puting down everything and adding all of these little features and extras available.</li>
        <li>👉<a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>, in my opinion, is great for communication of team members, especially if you connect Trello and <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a> to it. All the communications seats there and files can be shared. Furthermore, the experience is enhanced by using its native app. </li>
        <li>👉<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, as mentioned before, is multi-platform, it’s suitable for almost every programming language out there, and can be upgraded using plugins unlocking its full potential.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, some drawbacks could be pointed out like the lack of capabilities of Visual Studio to let different users edit the code at the same time.</p> 
    <p>I could have been more efficient when making my website if the foundation of it would have been a grid CSS layout and then building up the content from there by using flexbox. Once the content was properly positioned, I would have started adding styles to make it look nicer. Bottomline is that I need to take a lesson or two and experiment with it.</p> 
    <p>Working in teams for this project would have been a bit tricky because unless you use an online <strong>IDE</strong> (something like <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a>) as it’s quite challenging to break down the scripting tasks among the team members.  But definitely, there could have been a way to break down the tasks into <strong>divs</strong> to ease up the assembly of all pieces of code together later on.</p>

For next time, I would definitely set up an account on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> so every member could upload their files and everything could be centralised. Some other thing that could have been done is the use of <a href="https://docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> among the team.</p>
    <p>Something really beneficial and that works well among team members would have been to set up a <strong>repository</strong> and upload different versions to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>, then deploy the website from there.</p>

    <h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 3 - 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
    <p>The first part of the testing this project would consist of making sure that there are no grammar or spelling mistakes on the content and all the links are working properly (no broken links and opening in a new tab). For this purpose, the use of the <strong>Live Server</strong> has been really convenient.</p>
    <p>Then I would seek external feedback from a third party (e.g. family and friends), asking them what they think about the layout, if they found that the navigation was easy or confusing and if they would improve anything. 
    Additionally, I would ask if they wanted to see more interactivity. As a result, I would try to implement these onto the project. </p>

    <h2><a id="Outcome21"></a>Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page.</h2>
    <p>The chosen layout of my project is made of the <a href="index.html">main page</a> where most of the content is shown and contains the questions and answers required for this course, an <a href="about.html">about me</a> page where I tell a bit about myself and lastly, a page that contains all the 📜 <a href="references.html">references</a> that I have used to respond the questions.</p>
    <p>I have included a <strong>navbar</strong> in all of them so that the user could easily navigate among the pages. There are no sidebars put in place, so there's less confusion. </p>

    <h2>Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them, this includes people using different hardware, software, language, location, or ability (auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual).</p>
    <p>Examples of this include using alternative text in the markup code for visual impairment and allowing the website to work properly using the keyboard for those with limited motor control, or providing a text transcript for those users with a hearing disability.</p>
    <p>The Web must be accessible to provide <u>equal access and equal opportunity</u> to people with diverse abilities. Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
    <p>Accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction and hence, it can enhance your brand, drive innovation, and extend your market reach.</p>
