        <p>Hi! Carlos here, I’m glad to see you.</p> 
        <p>Originally from Spain, I am an enthusiastic professional individual who is seeking a new challenging career after many years of being in Sales, Admin, Marketing and Customer Service. I am a hard-working individual who strives to achieve the best in all areas, and I am always eager to learn new skills and advance my career.</p>           
        <p>The reason behind joining this course is that I wanted to uplift my existing knowledge in terms of coding so that I could better understand the syntax and logic of other programming languages, such as Javascript. So this course is a good starting point for my next steps.</p>            
        <p>After completing this course, I really want to dive in the frontend side of web development, training myself if needed in areas like making websites more interactive, Javascript and Typescript, Responsive design, working with APIS, building great sites with Flexbox and Grid CSS styles, learning UI design, feeling comfortable using GIT and finally learning React.</p>             
        <p>Hopefully, as I go along, I would start a portfolio to showcase all I have learnt and practised.</p>
        <p>Once I am able to master these, I would like to take it further by learning the backend side of it using Node.js and Mongodb.</p>           
        <p>I want to become a Web developer because it’s a creative industry where things are evolving all the time and you end up creating things that people use every day. In one word, Web developers are shaping the future especially nowadays when everything is evolving to the Web and mobile.</p> 
        <p>Thanks for your time.</p>
